I AM USING ONE(1) LATE DAYs FOR THIS PSET.

List of all files you submitted:

asst9.cpp, cvec.h (modified to retune same thing when norm is small)

Also copied over a bunch of stuff from asst8

Note the platform you used for development (Windows, OS X, ...):

OS X

Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile, or you are one of those hackers who insists on doing things differently.

I carried over makefile from last time. Use that. 

Indicate if you met all problem set requirements (more importantly, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs; we want to give you as much partial credit as we can).

Yep!

Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.

Added helper functions for converting between bunny and world frames (it takes worldToBunny by reference as input, so no repeated computing of that quat) and for finding the rest position of each mesh vertex. 

Used p,n,d vectors that can be uploaded for layers of the shell. 

Let us know how to run the program; what are the hot keys, mouse button usage, and so on? Describe steps or sequences of steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code (especially if your implementation strays from the assignment specification).

No, but use my make file

Finally, did you implement anything above and beyond the problem set? If so, document it in order for the TFs to test it and evaluate it.

No
